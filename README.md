# game-of-life.rs
Conway's game of life written in rust.

Two versions sorta done. 
One with zero dependencies where you enter coords to change blocks, 
the other uses crossterm and you can use your cursor to change blocks.
Controls:
- arrows to move
- enter to change block
- t for one tick
- n to see cursor position (for debuging)

Working on a wasm implementation.
